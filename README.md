# Shiny App using Spotify API

The main goal of this project was to practice building web apps with R

Web application using the Shiny R package and the Spotify APIs to collect artists' track audio
features. 

The app allows us to visualize and compare the distribution of calculated audio features such as the danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and speechiness of up to two artists.
